# Python Tutorial



# If you want to use this repository and learn python then start reading: 

* A [Module 1](module1.txt)
* A [Module 2](module2.txt)
* A [Module 3](module3.txt)
* A [Module 4](module4.txt)


~~and~~

The other .py extension files you see in this repository is jus an examples, they are scripts which you can use as you wish.
We use here python upper  3.*.* version

* Cheats:
 #### Creation of virtual environments is done by executing the command [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):
> #### python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
> #### For Windows users: c:\>python -m venv c:\path\to\myenv
> To activate go to last directory and type command: Scripts\activate 
> To deactiavte just type: deactivate

#### Second env I used is a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/">pipenv</a>
> to get it u can simply type: pip install pipenv
> to create environment type: pipenv install 
> to activate type: pipenv shell 
> to exit press: CRT + D
<br>

#### Another way
> 1. Set a virtual environment with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/virtualenvwrapper-win/">virtualenvwrapper</a>
<br>command: mkvirtualenv Project_Name
<br>Anything we install now will be specific to this project, and available to the projects we connect to this environment.
> 2. Set Project Directory
  <br>To bind our virtualenv with our current working directory we simply enter:
  <br>command: setprojectdir .  (notice there is a full stop mark)
>> 3. Deactivate
  <br>To move onto something else in the command line type ‘deactivate’ to deactivate your environment.
  <br>command: deactivate
  <br>Notice how the parenthesis disappear.
>> 4. Workon 
  <br>Open up the command prompt and type ‘workon Project_Name’ to activate the environment and move into your root project folder
  <br>command: workon Project_Name <br>

Sorry for a little bit mess, but I hadn't got time yet to make it more friendly.
