The other .py extension files you see in this repository is jus an examples, they are scripts which you can use as you wish.
We use here python upper  3.*.* version

* Cheats:
1. Set a virtual environment with [virtualenvwrapper](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenvwrapper-win/)
</br>command: mkvirtualenv Project_Name
</br>Anything we install now will be specific to this project, and available to the projects we connect to this environment.
2. Set Project Directory
  </br>To bind our virtualenv with our current working directory we simply enter:
  </br>command: setprojectdir .  (notice there is a full stop mark)
3. Deactivate
  </br>To move onto something else in the command line type ‘deactivate’ to deactivate your environment.
  </br>command: deactivate
  </br>Notice how the parenthesis disappear.
4. Workon 
  </br>Open up the command prompt and type ‘workon Project_Name’ to activate the environment and move into your root project folder
  </br>command: workon Project_Name <br>
